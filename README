This project is a demonstration of using the "contenteditable" attribute to edit an XML file in a web browser.

When index.php is loaded, it reads an XML file ('data.xml' is included as an example) and converts it to an HTML table. 

The cells of the table are made editable using the contenteditable attribute.

When the HTML table is saved, it is converted back to XML and saved to the original file ('data.xml'). 

Future possibilities:
* Use XSL for the transformations.
* Perform the transformations in Javascript.
* Allow an XML file to be uploaded for editing, then output when saved.
